# Reinforcement_Learning
LA Automaton: Tsetlin, Krinsky, Kyrlov, LRI

Initializing a finite state machine (satelite) which has 8 possible actions with 8 different results. 
Each result can vary due to 'signal noise' which would affect the learning automaton decision making.
Analyse 4 possible learning automata: Tsetlin, Krinsky, Krylov, and LRI. 
Variables: trials, iterations, ensemble, signal weights, noise.
Output showcases the difference between the several learning automaton and how the various properties that impact learning.
